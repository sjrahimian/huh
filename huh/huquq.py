"""Symbol Reasoning

    One option is the Greek uppercase œò (qoppa) to repersent Huquq, which decends from the Phoenician Qoph (ê§í), which in turn is 
    ancestor to the Arabic qƒÅf (the twenty-first letter of the Arabic alphabet) and one of the letters in huququ'llah. Qoph is the 
    nineteenth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician q≈çp ê§í, Hebrew q≈´pÃÑ ◊ß ‚Äé, Aramaic qop _, Syriac q≈çpÃÑ ‹©, 
    and Arabic qƒÅf ŸÇ (Wikipedia).

    Another option would be the first letter of "huquq", which is ÿ≠ (·∏•ƒÅ), a variant of (·∏™ƒÅ æ), "the sixth letter of the Arabic alphabet" 
    which is a variation of "Heth, sometimes written Chet, but more accurately ·∏§et" and ancestor to the Greek lowercase Õ∞ (Wikipedia).

    1 ·∏•uq√∫q or huquq (1 "rights") could be defined as the unit amount equal to 19 mithq√°ls of gold in currency 
    (e.g., $1 huquq = $1/mithq√°l * 19 mithq√°ls = $1/g * 69.192g)
